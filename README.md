# Helpful Git Programs

### Reopening the Project

Opening the VS Code program will automatically reopen whatever you last had open in VS Code. If that's not the project you want, once you have VS Code open, go to `File -> New Window`, click `Open Folder...` and select the `2023-Robot` folder. The one with this `README.md` file in it.
