# 2023 Robot

## Robot Programming Setup

### Install Development Software and Clone the Code

1. Download and install the WPILib version of VS Code along with other FRC Java tools using [these instructions](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html). While you're there, please bookmark the main page of [docs.wpilib.org](https://docs.wpilib.org/). There's a lot of information about FRC software and electronics here.
2. Setup a GitHub account if you haven't already.
3. Press your `F1` key to open VS Code's "Command Palette".
4. In the command palette, type "clone" and select "Git: Clone".
5. Select "Clone from GitHub".
6. Follow the prompts from VS Code and your web browser to sign into GitHub.
7. In VS Code select the `superhornets/2023-Robot` repository.
8. Select a location on your computer where you would like to have the robot code folder cloned to.
9. Click "Open in New Window".

# These are some helpful programs to help you work with Git. Each has it's own features and limitations.



### Reopening the Project

Opening the VS Code program will automatically reopen whatever you last had open in VS Code. If that's not the project you want, once you have VS Code open, go to `File -> New Window`, click `Open Folder...` and select the `2023-Robot` folder. The one with this `README.md` file in it.
